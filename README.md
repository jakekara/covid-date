# covid-date

Print the covid date since you entered lockdown. Each day is one year!

For those of us working at Yale, the start date was usually March
18. A future version may add a config file so you can change this
date, which is hard-coded right now. But probably not. If you want to
change the start date without adding dotfile support, the easiest
approach is to just fork this repo and modify covid_date.py.

### Install

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/jakekara/covid-date
```

### Usage

```bash
$ covid-date
Covid Year 105
```
